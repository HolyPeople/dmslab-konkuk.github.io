## Introduction to DMS Research Group
The DMS research group is currently concentrating on research and development related to Smart Mobility Systems and Bio-Medical/Healthcare intelligent Services based on distributed system technology and deep learning-based artificial intelligence technology.

### Dstributed System Technology
By utilizing Cloud Platform Technology, which has been researched and developed for over 10 years, we are currently focusing on the development of “Intelligent Fog Computing (IFC)” technology, which is the core of the 4th Industrial Revolution and 5G technology. In particular, we are researching intelligent IoT gateway development suitable for “Intelligent Assistant for Silver” and “Digital Twin System for Urban Air Mobility” application fields, automatic construction of a safe, stable and scalable fog computing server system, and intelligent operation management technology.

### Artificial Intelligence Technology 
Various studies are in progress in relation to AI technology based on deep learning. 1) Intelligent and efficient path planning and control based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), 2) Distributed Control technology for Swarm Mobility using Distributed Multiagent DRL technology, 3) Human Pose and Activity recognition technology based on Visual Transformer, 4) Object Detection, Face and Emotion Recognition technology using computer vision and widely used deep learning models such as CNN, ResNet, MobileNet, etc. 5) NLP Research on Open-Domain QA problem using BERT-based Retriever-Reader model, 6) Research on QA dataset creation competing Question Generation and Question Answering language models, 7) intelligent Chatbot technology supporting long-term conversation using Open Domain Knowledge etc.

### Core Research Focus
* Automatic construction and intelligent operation management technology of intelligent fog computing platforms (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, FaaS)
* Hierarchical Distributed Intelligent Fog and Cloud Cooperative Service Platform technology based on Offloading/Caching technolog
* Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Technology based on Multiple Attentions
* Cooperative Natural Language Conversation Technology based on Distributed Knowledge / Deep Learning
* Distributed system quality evaluation technology based on stochastic reward net and discrete event simulation 
* Efficient and reusable SW Architecture design technology suitable for domain function and quality requirements
