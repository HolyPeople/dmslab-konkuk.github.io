# VTRON(Virtual ClusTer Disk PROvisioNing Framework)
- Analyzing commonality and variability of software stacks of a VC by using Feature Model of the software product line (SPL)
- Retrieving reusable virtual disk images by the unique ID of each Feature Model and using the standardized reusable-asset management methodologies
- Generating XML-based virtual disk provisioning plan to describe disk creation methodologies, strategies and their relevant reusable assets
- Creating virtual disk images based on unified or union mounted disk provisioning mechanisms.

# Cloud Auto Provisioning For Simulation in the Loop(SITL)
- Generating a YAML-based cloud auto provisioning cloud simulation in the loop plan to create servers cluster for the Urban Air Mobility(UAM)
- Creating SITL virtual disk images based on unified or union mounted disk provisioning mechanisms via image provisioning profile yaml files.
- Automatically to set up the network environment of the simulation servers cluster via network provisioning profile yaml files.
