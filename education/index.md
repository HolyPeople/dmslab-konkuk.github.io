# Distributed System Classes

### Distributed Systems and Computing (4-1)
The DMS research group is currently concentrating on research and development related to Smart Mobility Systems and Bio-Medical/Healthcare intelligent Services based on distributed system technology and deep learning-based artificial intelligence technology.

### Next Generation Distributed Systems (4-2)
By utilizing Cloud Platform Technology, which has been researched and developed for over 10 years, we are currently focusing on the development of “Intelligent Fog Computing (IFC)” technology, which is the core of the 4th Industrial Revolution and 5G technology. In particular, we are researching intelligent IoT gateway development suitable for “Intelligent Assistant for Silver” and “Digital Twin System for Urban Air Mobility” application fields, automatic construction of a safe, stable and scalable fog computing server system, and intelligent operation management technology.

# Artificial Intelligent Classes

### Open Source Software Project 1 (3-1)
Various studies are in progress in relation to AI technology based on deep learning. 1) Intelligent and efficient path planning and control based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), 2) Distributed Control technology for Swarm Mobility using Distributed Multiagent DRL technology, 3) Human Pose and Activity recognition technology based on Visual Transformer, 4) Object Detection, Face and Emotion Recognition technology using computer vision and widely used deep learning models such as CNN, ResNet, MobileNet, etc. 5) NLP Research on Open-Domain QA problem using BERT-based Retriever-Reader model, 6) Research on QA dataset creation competing Question Generation and Question Answering language models, 7) intelligent Chatbot technology supporting long-term conversation using Open Domain Knowledge etc.
